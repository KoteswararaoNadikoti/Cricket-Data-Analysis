Welcome to the **Cricket Data Analysis** repository! This README provides an overview of the Cricket Players Formation, its objectives, and structure.

<br/>

## Overview

The IPL is a cricket tournament played among multiple teams. In this project, I developed a Microsoft Power BI dashboard to gather players for team formation and the creation of winning strategies for upcoming ODI's, T20's and Test matches..

<br/>

## Key Highlights

• **Data Cleaning** : I cleaned and preprocessed the acquired data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

• **Data Transformation & Data Modeling** : I transformed the raw data into a structured format, as well as I created relationships between various tables in order to connect them with each other making it ready for in-depth analysis.

• **Dashboard Creation** : I created dashboards that effectively communicated critical insights to stakeholders. These dashboards were designed to be user-friendly, allowing for easy interpretation of complex cricket statistics.

<br/>

## Insights

**Key Insights**:

• **Top Openers** : Identified the most explosive batsmen in the tournament, crucial for setting high run targets.

• **Top Middle Order** : Recognized players who provided stability and maintained the innings during crucial phases.

• **Top Finishers/Lower Order** : Highlighted batsmen with a knack for finishing games effectively under pressure.

• **Top All-rounders** : Identified versatile players who excelled both with the bat and ball, adding a dynamic dimension to the team.

• **Top Bowlers** : Recognized the leading wicket-takers and most economical bowlers, pivotal for restricting the opposition's scoring.

## Playing 11 Selection

One of the project's key outcomes was the creation of a formidable Playing 11 team. This selection was meticulously crafted, taking into account the top-performing players from the aforementioned categories. The aim was to assemble a balanced team capable of both setting competitive totals and successfully defending them.

## Tools/Libraries Used

• **Microsoft Power Query (Data Cleaning, Transformation and Modeling)**

• **Microsoft Power BI (For Dashboard Creation)**

• **DAX Measures (To create Calculated Columns)**
